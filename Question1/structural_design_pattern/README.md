# Structural Design Patterns

This folder contains examples of **Structural Design Patterns**. These patterns help you design and organize classes and objects to form larger structures while keeping your code efficient and flexible.

## Subfolders

### 1. [Adapter Pattern](./adapter)
The **Adapter Pattern** acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together. For more information, refer to the [README](./adapter/README.md) in the `adapter` folder.

### 2. [Composite Pattern](./composite)
The **Composite Pattern** allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. Check the [README](./composite/README.md) in the `composite` folder for more details.

Each subfolder includes explanations, example code, and detailed descriptions of the respective structural design patterns.
