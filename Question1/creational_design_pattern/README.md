# Creational Design Patterns

This folder contains examples of **Creational Design Patterns**. These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, allowing objects to be created in a flexible manner.

## Subfolders

### 1. [Factory Pattern](./Factory)
The **Factory Pattern** provides a way to encapsulate object creation, allowing a class to defer instantiation to subclasses. You can find more details in the [README](./Factory/README.md) inside the `Factory` folder.

### 2. [Prototype Pattern](./prototype)
The **Prototype Pattern** allows the creation of new objects by copying existing instances, thus enabling object creation without depending on their classes. For a detailed explanation, check the [README](./prototype/README.md) in the `prototype` folder.

Each subfolder contains code examples, explanations, and practical use cases of the respective creational design patterns.
