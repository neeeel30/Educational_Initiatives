# Behavioural Design Patterns

This folder contains examples of **Behavioural Design Patterns**. These design patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other.

## Subfolders

### 1. [Observer Pattern](./observer)
The **Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. You can find the implementation details and examples in the [README](./observer/README.md) inside the `observer` folder.

### 2. [State Pattern](./state)
The **State Pattern** allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. For more information, refer to the [README](./state/README.md) in the `state` folder.

Each subfolder provides detailed explanations, code examples, and use cases for the respective behavioural design pattern.
