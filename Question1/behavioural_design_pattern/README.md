# Behavioural Design Patterns

This folder contains examples of **Behavioural Design Patterns**. These design patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. 

## Subfolders

### 1. [Observer Pattern](./observer)
The **Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. For a full explanation and code examples, refer to the [README](./observer_pattern/README.md) inside the folder.

### 2. [State Pattern](./state)
The **Strategy Pattern** enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. For more details and examples, refer to the [README](./strategy_pattern/README.md).

Each subfolder contains code examples, explanations, and use cases for the respective behavioural design pattern.
